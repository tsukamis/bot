# South Bronx Bot
> Gambling on steroids, with an economy in its sidehand, fishing around its waist, and a stock market to tie it all together.

South Bronx bot adds a layer of irony to your server other bots fail to bring to the table, it was literally made because the gambling addiction in /furryporn was so bad we made a bot for it, then other servers wanted it, then we came here.

# __What Makes It Different?__
It's mainly written by one dude, but with all the [contributors on github](https://github.com/bronxbot/bot) (thank you all so much) it's mainly by the people for the people.. But mainly its not for profit, there isn't any premium or cash grab, we do it all for free. For the love of gambling ❤️

# BronxBots Features

# Accepted Variables
***Most*** commands that use economic values also accept these:
`1k = 1000`
`2.5% = 2.5 percentage of balance or wallet where applicable`

# Bazaar
> The bazaar is a marketplace / stock market hybrid that gets its price from its visitors
**How it works:**
```python
visitor_factor = len(self.visitors) * 0.5
spending_factor = math.log10(max(1, self.total_spent)) * 10
        
price = self.stock_base_price + visitor_factor + spending_factor
        
# Add some randomness
price *= random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)
```
